**Leci37/Leci37** is a _special_ repository because its `README.md` appears on your GitHub profile.  
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Iâ€™m currently learning: advanced LLM fine-tuning and cloud deployment with Docker  
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: AI in finance, computer vision, and open-source tools  
- Iâ€™m looking for help with: distribution strategies for retail AI  
- Ask me about: TensorFlow, Pine Script, AI deployment, TradingView automation  
- How to reach me: l.lecinana@gmail.com  
- Fun fact: I started with Arduino before jumping into full-stack ML systems
